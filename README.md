# Virtual Pet Adventure

## Short Description

Virtual Pet Adventure is a charming command-line simulation game that invites players to embark on a nurturing journey with their very own digital pet. Starting as an egg, the pet grows through progressive stages—baby, eagle, dove, peacock, or flamingo—based on player interactions. Users can feed, play, and guide their pet across a 6×8 grid map using simple WASD controls. Randomly placed items and regions introduce dynamic events and transformations, culminating in a race to reach the exit. Designed for casual gamers, programming enthusiasts, and educational settings, this Python project demonstrates object-oriented design while delivering an engaging and accessible gameplay experience.

## Usage
Run the game:

```bash
python game.py
```

## Controls

* `feed`: Feed your pet to restore hunger.
* `play`: Play with your pet to increase happiness (requires energy).
* `sleep`: Let your pet rest to restore energy.
* `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`: Move your pet on the grid once it hatches.
* `status`: View current pet stats.
* `0`: Quit the game.
